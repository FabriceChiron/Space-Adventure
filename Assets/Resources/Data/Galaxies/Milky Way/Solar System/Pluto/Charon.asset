  Name: Charon
  Details: "\"Charon, also known as (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five
    known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It was discovered in 1978
    at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic
    plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).
    With half the diameter and one eighth the mass of Pluto, it is a very large moon
    in comparison to its parent body. Its gravitational influence is such that the
    barycenter of the Pluto\u2013Charon system lies outside Pluto. In September 2016,
    astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon
    is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients
    of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and related gases released from
    the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred over about 19,000 km (12,000 mi) distance
    to the orbiting moon. The New Horizons spacecraft is the only probe that has
    visited the Pluto system. It approached Charon to within 27,000 km (17,000 mi)
    in 2015."
