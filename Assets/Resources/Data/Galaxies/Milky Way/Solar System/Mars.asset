  Name: Mars
  Details: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
    in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman
    god of war, and is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the reddish
    iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive
    among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial
    planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the
    impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
