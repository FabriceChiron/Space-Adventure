  Name: Callisto
  Details: "Callisto (Jupiter IV) is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede.
    It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System after Ganymede and Saturn's
    largest moon Titan, and the largest object in the Solar System not to be properly
    differentiated. Callisto was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. At 4821 km
    in diameter, Callisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only
    about a third of its mass. It is the fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter by distance,
    with an orbital radius of about 1883000 km. It is not in an orbital resonance
    like the three other Galilean satellites\u2014Io, Europa, and Ganymede\u2014and
    is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto's rotation is tidally locked
    to its orbit around Jupiter, so that the same hemisphere always faces inward;
    Jupiter appears to stand nearly still in Callisto's sky. It is less affected
    by Jupiter's magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more
    remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main radiation belt."
