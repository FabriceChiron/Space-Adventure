  Name: Titan
  Details: "Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest natural satellite
    in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere.<br><br>Titan
    is the sixth gravitationally rounded moon from Saturn. Frequently described as
    a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's moon and 80% more massive.
    It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede,
    and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in
    1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon
    of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the
    four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From
    Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4
    times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.<br><br>Titan is primarily composed
    of ice and rocky material. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense
    opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the Cassini\u2013Huygens
    mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon
    lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth,
    with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes
    have been found.<br><br>The atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components
    lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich organic
    smog. The climate\u2014including wind and rain\u2014creates surface features
    similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid
    methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns
    as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen
    atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle is analogous to Earth's water cycle, at the
    much lower temperature of about 94 K (\u2212179.2 \xB0C; \u2212290.5 \xB0F)."
