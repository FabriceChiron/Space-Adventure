  Name: TRAPPIST-1b
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1b</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 b</b>,
    is a mainly rocky, Venus-like exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf
    star TRAPPIST-1, located approximately 40 light-years (12 parsecs) away from
    Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was detected using the transit
    method, where a planet dims the host star's light as it passes in front of it.
    It was first announced on May 2, 2016, and between 2017 and 2018, more studies
    were able to refine its physical parameters.  The planet is about the same mass
    as Earth but about 12% larger. Its relatively low density, along with spectroscopic
    observations, has confirmed an extremely thick and hot atmosphere. Observations
    published in 2018 showed that the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1b was much larger than
    that of Earth or Venus, as well as being very hot and potentially rich in CO2.
    More recent modeling studies have suggested the planet is too hot to allow the
    formation of sulfuric acid clouds, such as are found on Venus, the hottest planet
    in our solar system.
