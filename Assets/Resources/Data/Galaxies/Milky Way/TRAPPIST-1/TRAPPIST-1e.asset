  Name: TRAPPIST-1e
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1e</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 e</b>,
    is a solid, close-to-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone
    around the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years (12 parsecs;
    380,000,000 million kilometres; 240,000,000 million miles) away from Earth in
    the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method,
    in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its
    star is measured.  It was one of seven new exoplanets discovered orbiting the
    star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Three of the seven
    (e, f, and g) are in the habitable zone. TRAPPIST-1e is similar to Earth's mass,
    radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux. It is also confirmed
    to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in our solar system. 
    In November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the
    multiplanetary system, TRAPPIST-1e is the one with the greatest chance of being
    an Earth-like ocean planet and the one most worthy of further study regarding
    habitability. According to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, TRAPPIST-1e is one
    of the most potentially habitable exoplanets discovered so far.
