  Name: TRAPPIST-1h
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1h</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 h</b>,
    is an exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 39 light-years
    (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. It was one of four
    new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star using observations from the
    Spitzer Space Telescope. Throughout 2017 and 2018, more studies were able to
    refine its physical parameters.  The outermost known planet in its system, it
    is roughly one third the mass of Earth, and about 77% as large. Its relatively
    low density indicates that it is likely water-rich, like several other planets
    in the system.
