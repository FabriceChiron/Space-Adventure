  Name: TRAPPIST-1g
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1g</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 g</b>,
    is an exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 39 light-years
    (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. It was one of four
    new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star using observations from the
    Spitzer Space Telescope. The exoplanet is within the optimistic habitable zone
    of its host star. It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming
    effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. 
    The second most distant known planet in its system, TRAPPIST-1g is a planet larger
    than Earth yet less dense, meaning it likely hosts some form of water.
