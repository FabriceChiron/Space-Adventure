  Name: TRAPPIST-1f
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1f</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 f</b>,
    is an exoplanet, likely rocky but under a massive water-steam gaseous envelope
    at very high pressure and temperature, orbiting within the habitable zone around
    the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 40 light-years (12 parsecs) away from Earth
    in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit
    method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front
    of its star is measured.  It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered
    orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope.  The planet
    is an eyeball planet candidate.
