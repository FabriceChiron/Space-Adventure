  StarDescription: The largest star in the system, Gliese 667 A (GJ 667 A), is a
    K-type main-sequence star of stellar classification K3V. It has about 73% of
    the mass of the Sun and 76% of the Sun's radius, but is radiating only around
    12-13% of the luminosity of the Sun. The concentration of elements other than
    hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is much lower
    than in the Sun with a relative abundance of around 26% solar. The apparent visual
    magnitude of this star is 6.29, which, at the star's estimated distance, gives
    an absolute magnitude of around 7.07 (assuming negligible extinction from interstellar
    matter).
