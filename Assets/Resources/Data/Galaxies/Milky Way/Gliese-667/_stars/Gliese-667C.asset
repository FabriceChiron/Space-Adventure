  Name: Gliese-667C
  StarDescription: Gliese 667 C is the smallest star in the system, with only around
    31% of the mass of the Sun and 42% of the Sun's radius, orbiting approximately
    230 AU from the Gliese 667 AB pair. It is a red dwarf with a stellar classification
    of M1.5. This star is radiating only 1.4% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer
    atmosphere at a relatively cool effective temperature of 3,700 K. This temperature
    is what gives it the red-hued glow that is a characteristic of M-type stars.
    The apparent magnitude of the star is 10.25, giving it an absolute magnitude
    of about 11.03. It is known to have a system of two planets; claims have been
    made for five additional planets but this may be an error due to failure to account
    for correlated noise in the radial velocity data. The red dwarf status of the
    star would allow planet Cc, which is in the habitable zone, to receive minimal
    amounts of ultraviolet radiation.
